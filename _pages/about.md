Katharina Eggensperger is an Early Career Research Group Leader [AutoML for Science](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/research/research/cluster-research-groups/research-groups/automl-for-science/) in the Cluster of 
Excellence [Machine Learning for Science](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/home/) at 
the University of TÃ¼bingen.

Her research focuses on methods for *automated machine learning (AutoML)*, *hyperparameter optimization (HPO)*, and *efficient 
benchmarking*. Motivated by the goal of further democratizing the application of machine learning for scientific researchers 
and practitioners, she researches how to improve and extend AutoML systems to leverage the full potential of ML for new applications.

Previously, she was part of the [ML Lab](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/) at the University of Freiburg, where 
she completed her Ph.D. under the supervision of [Frank Hutter](https://ml.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/profile/hutter/) 
and [Marius Lindauer](https://www.ai.uni-hannover.de/de/institut/team/lindauer) (2022). Katharina also co-developed 
open-source tools for HPO methods and AutoML systems and has been a member of the team winning three AutoML 
competitions (2016, 2018, 2020). She is part of the [Automl.org](automl.org) group, co-organized the AutoML workshop 
series at ICML in [2019](https://sites.google.com/view/automl2019icml/), [2020](https://sites.google.com/view/automl2020/home) 
and [2021](https://sites.google.com/view/automl2021) and serves as a social 
chair for the [AutoML Conference](www.automl.cc) in 2022 and 2023.
