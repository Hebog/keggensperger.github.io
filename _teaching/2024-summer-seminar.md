Have you heard about AutoML? Do you wonder what LLMs can do for AutoML and vice versa? Then this seminar is for you!

**TL;DR** AutoML aims to support ML users (and ML researchers) by 
automating parts of the ML workflow. In this seminar we will read recent
research papers in the field of AutoML with a focus on methods for and with LLMs 
and pre-trained models.

Why should you attend this seminar?
---
Besides practicing your scientific communication skills, you will also 
  * learn about key contributions in the field of AutoML
  * be able to discuss recent research on AutoML with and for LLMs
  * gain experience in reading, understanding and presenting research papers 

Requirements
---
We strongly recommend that you know the foundations of machine learning and 
deep learning. Ideally, you also have some experience in applying ML to get 
the most out of this seminar.

Topics
---
The seminar focuses on understanding the underlying concepts of modern
AutoML methods. Since this field is ever-growing, in this semester, 
we will focus on only a few topics as stated above. 

Here is a *tentative* meeting schedule:

How the seminar will look like?
---

We will meet each week (with a few exceptions). In the first two weeks, we will start with introductory lectures on automated machine learning, empirical experimentation and how to critically review and present research papers. After that, each week, we will have presentations, followed by discussions.

Other Important information
---

**Registration:** Please register on ILIAS. The number of participants is limited and the registration opens on March 29th, noon. 
There will be a waiting list (please unregister to let other people take your place).
