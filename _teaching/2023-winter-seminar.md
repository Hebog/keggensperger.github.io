Have you ever trained an ML model and wondered how to efficiently optimize its hyperparameters? Have you heard of 
AutoML and want to learn more?

TL;DR
======
AutoML aims to support ML users (and ML researchers) by automating parts of the ML workflow. In this seminar we will
read some classic and recent research papers in the field of AutoML with a focus on hyperparameter optimization using 
Bayesian optimization and AutoML systems for tabular data. 

Why should you attend this seminar?
======
Besides practicing your presentation skills, you will also 
  * identify and discuss challenges in the field of AutoML
  * learn about recent research in the field of hyperparameter optimization and AutoML systems
  * gain experience in reading, understanding and presenting research papers 

Requirements
======
We strongly recommend that you know the foundations of machine learning and deep learning. Ideally, you also have some 
experience in applying ML to get the most out of this seminar.

Topics
======
The seminar focuses on understanding the underlying concepts of modern AutoML methods. Since this field is ever-growing,
in this semester, we will focus on only a few subfields.

The papers will be announced shortly.

How the seminar will look like?
======
We will meet each week (with a few exceptions). In each meeting, we will have presentations and discussions. 
The specifics will be provided here shortly.
